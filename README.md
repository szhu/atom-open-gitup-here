# Open GitUp Here

Open the current project in the [GitUp](http://gitup.co/) app with a menu item or key combo.

Note: I'm aware of the [`open-gitup`](https://atom.io/packages/open-gitup) Atom package, but that package doesn't work if there's no file open. This one does!

Forked from <https://github.com/blueimp/atom-open-terminal-here>.
